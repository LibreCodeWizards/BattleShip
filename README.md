# Battleship Game 🚢💥

Welcome to the Battleship game project! This README will guide you through navigating the project, compiling it, and running the game.

## Project Structure 📂

The project is organized as follows:

- **`/src`**: Contains the source code files for the game.
  - **`main.c`**: The entry point and driver code for the game.
  - **`/src/ast`**: Contains essential game functions, including the bot logic and other core components.

## How to Compile the Game ⚙️

To make our lives easier (actually, this was done by me, @aza161), we decided to use **CMake** for managing the build process.

### 1. Install CMake 🛠️
To get started, you’ll need to install CMake. Visit the [CMake Download Page](https://cmake.org/download/) and download the appropriate version for your operating system.

### 2. Set Up VSCode 🖥️
- **Install VSCode**: If you haven't already, download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
- **Install CMake Extension**: After installing VSCode, open it and search for "CMake" in the Extensions Marketplace to install the CMake extension.
- **Install C/C++ Extensions**: Make sure you install the necessary C/C++ extensions in VSCode for proper code editing and debugging.

### 3. Build and Run the Game 🏁
- **Clone the repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine and open it in VSCode.
- **Build the project**: After setting up the necessary extensions, you can build the project by clicking the **Run** button located in the CMake extension panel at the bottom of VSCode.

This will configure the project, compile the code, and run the game.
