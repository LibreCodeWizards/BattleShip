   ```

#### On **Linux** (Fedora/RHEL):
1. Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   sudo dnf update
   sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"
   ```

#### On **macOS**:
1. Install the Xcode Command Line Tools, which include `make`, by running:
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```

#### On **Windows**:
1. Install `make` using **MinGW**:
   - Download and install [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/).
   - During installation, ensure you select the `mingw32-base` package.
2. **Set MinGW as a System Environment Variable**:
   - Open the **Start Menu**, search for "Environment Variables," and select **Edit the system environment variables**.
   - In the System Properties window, click the **Environment Variables** button.
   - Under **System Variables**, click **New** and add:
     - **Variable Name**: `MinGW`
     - **Variable Value**: `C:\MinGW\bin` (or the path where MinGW is installed).
   - Click **OK** to save and close the windows.
